
Step 1: Cable connections:

	[AC Adapter] <---> [PWR 1]
	[MGMT] <---> [PC Interface]
	[Console via MicroUSB] <---> [PC USB Port]


Step 2: Establish connection to the PA-220

	*The MGMT port of the PA-220 has a default IP address of 192.168.1.1
	
	To establish connection to the PA-220, change the IP address of the PC to a valid IP in the 192.168.1.0 subnet.
		
		1. Open 'Run' (windows button + r)
		
		2. Enter 'ncpa.cpl
		
		3. Right-Click Ethernet -> Properties
		
		4. Select 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)' -> Properties
		
		5. Choose 'Use the following IP address:'
		
		6. Configure the following:
			IP address: 	192.168.1.2
			Subnet Mask: 	255.255.255.0
		
		7. Click 'OK'
		
		8. Make sure to 'Close' Ethernet Properties instead of clicking on the 'X' button. Otherwise the settings will not be applied.

		9. Verify the changes by opening cmd, then:
		
				ping 192.168.1.1
				ping 192.168.1.2
		

Step 3: Access the Web Interface

	1. Open a browser.
	
	2. Type the PA-220's IP address on the URL: https://192.168.1.1
	
	*If the Web Interface is not responding or taking too long, use firefox and open the browser in incognito mode.

	3. Login
	
		Username: admin
		Password: C1sc0123
		
		*If login fails, simply wait. For some reason the device allows you to login even though it's not ready and hasn't recognize account informations.
